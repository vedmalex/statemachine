## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Memory Bank 3.0 System
**Objective:** Set up the complete Memory Bank 3.0 environment with all required components and tracking systems.

**Actions:**
1. Display mandatory introduction message exactly once at conversation start
2. Auto-scan current workspace for issues, LEVER opportunities, and Git repository presence
3. Create/update essential tracking files (unified ISSUES.md, PRD.md, ARCH.md)
4. Load mandatory context files into working memory
5. Initialize documentation discovery and integration system
6. Set up monorepo detection and subproject memory banks if applicable

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Mandatory introduction displayed with scanning and loading messages
- [ ] Workspace scan completed and results documented in tracking files
- [ ] All essential context files loaded and accessible
- [ ] ISSUES.md created/updated with unified bug and must-have tracking
- [ ] ISSUES.md LEVER section created/updated with reuse opportunities
- [ ] PRD.md and ARCH.md created/updated with project requirements and architecture
- [ ] Documentation integration completed with bidirectional references

- Test access to loaded context files and their content
- Validate ISSUES.md format matches template with semantic naming (BUG-XXX, MH-XXX)
- Verify ISSUES.md LEVER section contains identified reuse opportunities
- Check PRD.md and ARCH.md contain relevant project information

### Step 2: Process Natural Language Commands
**Objective:** Interpret user requests using natural language patterns and route to appropriate workflow phases.

**Actions:**
1. Parse incoming user messages for intent recognition
2. Map natural language patterns to specific workflow actions
3. Extract task parameters and context from user input
4. Validate user permissions and phase requirements
5. Route to appropriate workflow phase with proper context

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Natural language patterns correctly identified and mapped
- [ ] User intent accurately determined from input
- [ ] Task parameters extracted and validated
- [ ] Appropriate workflow phase selected based on intent
- [ ] Context properly prepared for selected phase
- [ ] User permissions validated for requested actions

**Validation Method:**
- Test recognition of all defined natural language patterns
- Verify correct routing to appropriate workflow phases
- Confirm parameter extraction accuracy
- Validate permission checks prevent unauthorized actions
- Test context preparation includes all necessary information

### Step 2.1: Detailed Planning Before Each Item Execution (CRITICAL)
**Objective:** Ensure each individual plan item is thoroughly detailed immediately before its execution to maintain quality and prevent incomplete implementations, with detailing level dependent on item complexity.

**MANDATORY PROCESS:**
Before executing EACH INDIVIDUAL plan item (not during initial planning phase), the following detailed planning process MUST be completed:

**Actions:**
1. **Complexity Estimation and Fast Track Assessment:**
   - Estimate complexity for the current plan item (Low: simple tasks, Medium: moderate effort, High: complex with multiple dependencies)
   - **Fast Track Qualification:** Immediately identify candidates for simplified planning:
     - **Auto-qualification:** Single-file changes, bug fixes <20 lines, documentation updates, simple refactoring
     - **Quick Check:** "Is this a straightforward task with clear implementation path and minimal dependencies?"
   - **Fast Track Process:** For qualifying tasks, use streamlined planning:
     - Skip detailed verification step
     - Use minimal breakdown (2-3 sub-steps maximum)
     - Document decision to use fast track with brief justification
     - Proceed directly to implementation after minimal planning
   - For non-fast track items: Review if the item can be detailed and ensure all plan items are structured to allow meaningful detailing

2. **Plan Verification (IMPLEMENT Phase Only, Skip for Fast Track Items):**
   - **Timing**: Execute immediately before task implementation within IMPLEMENT phase
   - **Pragmatic Approach:** Focus on high-value verification activities:
     - For Medium complexity: Quick verification with minimal documentation
     - For High complexity only: Full verification with comprehensive documentation
   - **Objective Validation**: Use concrete criteria to validate complexity:
     - Low: Single file modification, no external dependencies, <50 lines of code
     - Medium: Multiple file changes, 1-2 external dependencies, 50-200 lines of code
     - High: Cross-module changes, 3+ dependencies, >200 lines of code, architectural impact
   - **Adjustment Protocol**: If complexity assessment differs from initial estimate by more than one level, update plan accordingly
   - **Stakeholder Input**: Consider user feedback or domain expert input if available
   - **Documentation**: Record verification results and any adjustments in plan.md

3. **Detailed Step Breakdown (Complexity-Dependent):**
   - Break down the plan item into sub-steps based on verified complexity: Low (3-4 sub-steps), Medium (4-6), High (5-7)
   - Define exactly what needs to be done, how it should be done, and how to verify completion
   - Include specific file paths, function names, and implementation details where applicable
   - Identify all dependencies and prerequisites for the step

4. **Plan File Update:**
   - Update the current `plan.md` file with the detailed breakdown, verified complexity estimate, and sub-steps for the CURRENT item
   - Replace the high-level description with complexity-dependent instructions
   - Include verification criteria for each sub-step
   - Add estimated time based on verified complexity
   - Document any complexity adjustments and rationale

5. **Quality Assurance Planning:**
   - Define specific testing requirements for the step
   - Plan test coverage strategy (unit tests, integration tests, UI tests with Playwright)
   - Specify acceptance criteria and validation methods
   - Include error handling and edge case considerations

6. **Progress Tracking Setup:**
   - Create trackable milestones within the step
   - Set up progress indicators for both file-based and environment tracking
   - Define completion criteria that can be objectively verified
   - Plan documentation and artifact creation requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Fast track qualification assessed for all tasks
- [ ] Simple tasks identified and processed through streamlined planning
- [ ] Complexity estimated for each non-fast track item (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] Plan verification completed for Medium and High complexity items only
- [ ] Complexity re-assessed using objective criteria for non-fast track items
- [ ] Documentation level appropriate to task complexity (minimal for Low, comprehensive for High)
- [ ] Complexity estimated for each item (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] Plan verification completed within IMPLEMENT phase before execution
- [ ] Complexity re-assessed using objective criteria (file count, dependencies, code volume)
- [ ] Complexity adjustments documented with clear rationale
- [ ] Plan reviewed and revised if items not detail-able (too granular)
- [ ] Detailing level matches verified complexity (more sub-steps for higher complexity)
- [ ] All plan items structured for effective detailing
- [ ] Each plan item broken down into 3-7 specific, actionable sub-steps
- [ ] All sub-steps include clear "what", "how", and "verification" components
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites clearly identified and documented
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for each implementation step
- [ ] Progress tracking mechanisms established
- [ ] plan.md file updated with comprehensive details before execution begins
- [ ] Verification criteria specified for each sub-step completion
- [ ] Documentation requirements planned for complex implementations

**Validation Method:**
- Verify plan.md contains detailed breakdown before any implementation begins
- Confirm each sub-step has clear completion criteria
- Validate testing strategy covers all implementation aspects
- Check that progress tracking tools are properly configured
- Ensure all dependencies are identified and accounted for
- Verify complexity estimates in plan.md
- Confirm plan verification step completed before implementation
- Check complexity re-assessment used objective criteria
- Validate complexity adjustments are documented
- Confirm plan revisions occurred for non-detail-able items
- Check detailing depth corresponds to verified complexity

**Integration with Existing Workflow:**
- Fast track assessment occurs at the beginning of planning process
- Streamlined planning for simple, well-understood tasks
- Full verification only for tasks that truly benefit from it
- Flexible documentation requirements based on complexity
- Initial complexity estimation during planning phase (rough estimate)
- Plan verification occurs within IMPLEMENT phase before actual execution
- Verification uses concrete implementation context for accurate assessment
- Adjustments feed back into detailed planning process
- This detailed planning step occurs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE executing each individual plan item
- NOT during the initial planning phase, but as a prerequisite for each item execution
- Updates both file-based plan.md and environment tracking systems for the current item
- Integrates with phase-specific checklists to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Maintains traceability between high-level goals and detailed implementation steps
- **CRITICAL TIMING**: Plan → Select Next Item → Detail Current Item → Execute Current Item → Repeat

### Step 3: Execute LEVER-Integrated Workflow Phases
**Objective:** Execute the selected workflow phase with integrated LEVER analysis and architectural boundary validation.

**Actions:**
1. Apply LEVER methodology before any new code implementation
2. Check for existing solutions within architectural boundaries
3. Validate against FSD/VSA principles for proper isolation
4. Execute phase-specific logic (VAN, PLAN, IMPLEMENT, QA, etc.)
5. Update tracking files with applied LEVER decisions
6. Maintain architectural integrity throughout implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] LEVER analysis completed before implementation decisions
- [ ] Existing code patterns identified and evaluated for reuse
- [ ] Architectural boundaries respected (FSD layers, VSA slices)
- [ ] Phase-specific objectives achieved with quality validation
- [ ] ISSUES.md LEVER section updated with applied reuse decisions
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Tests created with 85% coverage minimum and 100% pass rate

**Validation Method:**
- Verify LEVER analysis documented in ISSUES.md LEVER section
- Confirm architectural boundaries maintained
- Test implementation against phase-specific success criteria
- Validate code quality and test coverage requirements
- Check tracking file updates reflect current status

### Step 4: Maintain Context and Quality Throughout Lifecycle
**Objective:** Ensure continuous context awareness and quality validation across all phases and operations.

**Actions:**
1. Maintain loaded context throughout session with automatic refresh
2. Apply phase-specific checklist templates for consistency
3. Validate all implementations against requirements and conventions
4. Update documentation and guides in docs/ directory structure
5. Evolve CODING_RULES.md with discovered patterns
6. Ensure comprehensive code documentation with language-specific standards

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Context remains current and accessible throughout session
- [ ] Phase-specific checklists applied and completed
- [ ] All implementations validated against established requirements
- [ ] Documentation created in proper docs/ directory structure
- [ ] CODING_RULES.md updated with new patterns and conventions
- [ ] Code documentation follows language-specific standards (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- [ ] All public functions and complex algorithms documented with examples

**Validation Method:**
- Test context refresh and accessibility throughout session
- Verify checklist completion for each phase
- Validate implementations against requirements traceability matrix
- Check documentation placement in docs/ directory

- **Loading Commands:**
  - **Automatic:** Files loaded based on current phase and task
  - **Manual:** User can request specific files: "Load [filename]", "Include [directory]"
  - **Refresh:** "Refresh context", "Reload files", "Update context"
  - **Status:** "Show loaded context", "What files are loaded?"

### Context Loading Examples:
```
🔄 CONTEXT LOADED:
✅ memory-bank/system/PRD.md (Product requirements)
✅ memory-bank/system/ARCH.md (Architecture overview)
✅ BUGS.md (3 open issues)
✅ MUST_HAVE.md (2 critical items)
✅ memory-bank/tasks/2025-01-15_TASK-003_auth/artifacts/phase-context.md
✅ User artifacts: spec/auth-requirements.pdf

📊 CONTEXT SUMMARY:
- Project: User Authentication System
- Current Phase: IMPLEMENT
- Critical Issues: JWT token validation, Password hashing
- Architecture: VSA with FSD frontend
- Requirements: OAuth2 + local auth support
```

### Empty Project Initialization (PRD/ARCH)
- If workspace appears empty (no source files, no recognizable project structure):
  - Start an interactive, minimal questionnaire and write answers to `memory-bank/system/PRD.md`.
  - Ask only essential questions (goal, audience, key features, NFRs, constraints, acceptance criteria).
  - Defer any code generation until IMPLEMENT or explicit user request.
- If the user provides requirements directly (message or file):
  - Persist them into `memory-bank/system/PRD.md` (append or update coherent sections).
- For non-empty projects:
  - Auto-generate or update `memory-bank/system/ARCH.md` based on current repository structure and conventions.
  - If architecture is unclear, write assumptions and mark TBD items in ARCH.

- "Migrate to ISSUES.md" - Backup and consolidate existing BUGS.md and MUST_HAVE.md
- Preserve semantic naming (BUG-XXX, MH-XXX)
- Never delete originals without user confirmation


## Ultra-Safe Git Integration

### Git Safety Protocol
```
Pre-flight → Backup → Validation → Execution → Rollback Ready
```

### Git Detection & Analysis (If Enabled)
- **Conditional activation**: Only if Git integration is enabled in mode settings
- Detect Git repository presence (skip if not found)
- Analyze existing branch naming conventions when repository exists
- Identify main branch (main/master/develop) from remote configuration
- Check current Git status before any operation
- **Graceful fallback**: Continue without Git if repository unavailable or access denied

### Branch Management (Ultra-Safe)
- **Pre-check**: Verify clean working directory or offer stash
- **User confirmation**: Always ask before creating/switching branches
- **Naming**: `task/TASK-ID_description` or `feature/description`
- **Fallback**: Continue on current branch if creation fails
- **No force operations**: Never force-push, force-merge, force-checkout

### Smart Staging (Bulletproof)
```
Safety Protocol:
1. Check Git status → Show current state
2. If staged changes exist → MANDATORY user choice:
   - Commit existing changes
   - Stash existing changes
   - Cancel operation
3. Stage ONLY files modified by Memory Bank
4. Show staging diff before any commit
5. Never auto-commit without explicit approval
```

### Git Workflow Integration
- **Task Creation**: Ask "Create feature branch? [y/N]"
- **IMPLEMENT Phase**: Ask "Stage modified files? [y/N]"
- **QA Phase**: Offer commit preparation, never auto-commit
- **ARCHIVE Phase**: Suggest merge, never auto-merge

### Error Handling (Fail-Safe)
- **Git disabled**: Skip all Git operations, continue with file-only workflow
- **Git unavailable**: Continue without Git, show informational warning
- **Permission denied**: Show error, suggest manual resolution, continue file-only
- **Repository not found**: Skip Git operations, continue with normal workflow
- **Any Git error**: Log full error, provide recovery suggestions, never block workflow
- **Always inform user**: Never fail silently, clear status about Git availability

## PRD Handling (Min)
- Persist product requirements to `memory-bank/system/PRD.md`.
- Accept input from interactive questionnaire, inline text, or uploaded files.
- Update sections in place; avoid duplicates; timestamp significant changes.
- Reference PRD in planning/implementation decisions and acceptance criteria.
 - On initialization for both empty and existing projects, ensure `PRD.md` is present and populated with current known requirements.

### PRD.md Template
```markdown
# PRD — Product Requirements Document

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Technical constraints: ...
- Business constraints: ...

```

## Architecture Handling (Min)
- Analyze current project structure to generate `memory-bank/system/ARCH.md`.
- Capture frameworks, languages, modules, data flow, and integration points.
- When project is empty, create an initial skeleton with TBD markers and update as code emerges.
- Re-run architecture update after significant structural changes.
- While developing from an empty project, incrementally populate ARCH.md with the evolving project structure.
- Prefer a one-feature-per-folder structure; deviate only when LEVER indicates reuse/merge reduces duplication and complexity.

## Harmonized LEVER + FSD + VSA Integration
- **Purpose:** Resolve potential conflicts between LEVER (reuse-focused), FSD (layer-structured), and VSA (feature-isolated) methodologies through unified decision-making framework.
- **Core Principle:** **"Structured Reuse with Bounded Isolation"** - maximize reuse within architectural boundaries while maintaining clear feature isolation.

### **Context-Aware Decision Examples:**

#### **Early Stage Project (VSA-Heavy)**
```
🔍 User Authentication needed
👉 Quick implementation: features/auth/ with minimal abstraction
👉 No premature shared components - wait for second similar feature
👉 Focus on working software over perfect architecture
📄 ISSUES.md: [LEV-001] Auth patterns noted for future extraction
```

#### **Growing Project (Balanced)**
```
🔍 Payment Processing needed (second payment-related feature)
👉 Apply FSD structure: features/payment-processing/
👉 Extract payment utilities to shared/ (2-use rule triggered)
👉 Moderate LEVER analysis for obvious duplications
📄 ISSUES.md: [LEV-002] Payment abstraction created, [DUP-003] Eliminated duplicate validation
```

#### **Enterprise Project (LEVER-Heavy)**
```
🔍 New reporting feature requested
👉 Full LEVER analysis: 3 existing report types found
👉 Extract comprehensive reporting framework to domain/
👉 Apply strict FSD boundaries with shared component governance
📄 ISSUES.md: [COMP-004] Simplified using existing report framework
```

### **Adaptive Guidelines:**

#### **1. Dynamic Abstraction Rules:**
- **Early Stage:** 1-use rule (immediate duplication triggers extraction)
- **Growth Stage:** 2-use rule (second occurrence triggers consideration)
- **Mature Stage:** 3-use rule (third occurrence triggers shared component)
- **Legacy Stage:** Pattern consolidation (proactive refactoring)

#### **2. Flexible Boundary Management:**
- **Strict Boundaries:** Enterprise/mature projects with multiple teams
- **Moderate Boundaries:** Growing projects with emerging patterns
- **Loose Boundaries:** Early stage/small team projects prioritizing velocity

#### **3. Context-Driven Priorities:**

**Delivery-Focused Context:**
1. Feature completion first
2. Minimal viable architecture
3. Document patterns for later optimization

**Pattern-Recognition Context:**
1. Balance delivery with emerging patterns
2. Extract obvious duplications
3. Build foundation for scaling

**Optimization-Focused Context:**
1. Comprehensive analysis before implementation
2. Proactive pattern consolidation
3. Long-term maintainability over velocity

#### **4. Hybrid Decision Process:**
```
1. Assess current project context and constraints
2. Choose appropriate methodology emphasis from Flexibility Matrix
3. Apply adapted rules based on chosen emphasis
4. Document decision rationale in ISSUES.md
5. Review and adjust approach as project evolves
```

### **Adaptive Implementation Examples:**

#### **Startup Mode (VSA-Heavy): User Auth**
```
🎯 Context: 2-person team, MVP deadline in 2 weeks
👉 Decision: Fast delivery over perfect architecture

Implementation:
- features/auth/ (single feature folder)
- Inline validation, direct API calls
- No premature abstractions

📄 ISSUES.md: [LEV-001] Auth patterns identified for future extraction
```

#### **Scale-Up Mode (Balanced): Adding Payment**
```
🎯 Context: 5-person team, second similar feature, growing codebase
👉 Decision: Extract obvious patterns, maintain reasonable structure

Implementation:
- features/payment-processing/
- shared/api/http-client.ts (extracted from auth + payment)
- entities/user/ (shared entity)
- Keep feature-specific validation separate

📄 ISSUES.md: [LEV-002] HTTP client extracted, [DUP-001] API patterns unified
```

#### **Enterprise Mode (LEVER-Heavy): Notification System**
```
🎯 Context: 15-person team, 4th notification-related feature
👉 Decision: Comprehensive analysis and optimization

Implementation:
- domain/notification/ (business logic abstraction)
- shared/infrastructure/messaging/ (technical infrastructure)
- features/email-notifications/ (specific feature)
- features/push-notifications/ (specific feature)

📄 ISSUES.md: [COMP-003] Notification complexity reduced via domain layer
```

### **Evolution Guidance:**
- **Regular Context Assessment:** Review project stage monthly
- **Methodology Adjustment:** Shift emphasis as project matures
- **Pattern Harvesting:** Continuously identify reuse opportunities
- **Architecture Evolution:** Gradually improve structure without disrupting delivery

## System Code Architecture (Vertical Slice)
- Principle: group by features, not by technical types. Prefer one feature → one folder when not in conflict with LEVER.
- Independence: slices must not depend on each other. Shared logic lives in `domain` or `shared`. No direct imports like `../another-feature`.
- Abstractions first: business logic depends on abstractions, not details. Features/domain must avoid concrete library dependencies.
- Composition root: the `app` (or equivalent) composes domain and infrastructure implementations.
- Pragmatic DDD: start simple (anemic domain) and add behavior when needed.

### Example: Execution Flow inside `create-order`
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Controller
    participant Handler
    participant IOrderRepository
    participant Order as Order (Entity)

    Client->>+Controller: POST /orders { ... }
    Controller->>Controller: DTO Validation (Command)
    Controller->>+Handler: execute(command)
    Handler->>Order: new Order(...)
    Handler->>Order: order.applyDiscount(...)
    Handler->>+IOrderRepository: save(order)
    IOrderRepository-->>-Handler: Promise<void>
    Handler-->>-Controller: Result.Ok()
    Controller-->>-Client: 201 Created
```

### Monolith or Microservices?
- VSA is ideal for a maintainable monolith that can be split later.
- Strong internal boundaries between features prevent a Big Ball of Mud.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Monolith with Vertical Slice Architecture"
        direction TB
        EntryPoint("API Gateway / Entry Point")

        subgraph "Vertical Slices (in one process)"
            direction LR
            F1("Feature: User Management")
            F2("Feature: Order Processing")
            F3("Feature: Catalog Management")
        end

        DB("(Shared Database)")

        EntryPoint --> F1
        EntryPoint --> F2
        EntryPoint --> F3

        F1 --> DB
        F2 --> DB
        F3 --> DB

        %% Dotted line for weak coupling via event bus
        F2 -.-> F3
    end

    style F1 fill:#b6d7a8
    style F2 fill:#b6d7a8
    style F3 fill:#b6d7a8
```

### Path to Microservices
- Vertical slices become natural candidates for extraction.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Before: Monolith"
        direction LR
        F1("Feature: Orders")
        F2("Feature: Catalog")
        DB1("(Shared DB)")
        F1 --> DB1
        F2 --> DB1
    end

    subgraph "After: Microservice Extraction"
        direction TB
        subgraph "Orders Service (remaining monolith)"
            F1_new("Feature: Orders")
            DB1_new("(Orders DB)")
            F1_new --> DB1_new
        end

        subgraph "New Catalog Service"
            F2_new("Feature: Catalog")
            DB2_new("(Catalog DB)")
            F2_new --> DB2_new
        end

        F1_new -- API Call --> F2_new
    end

    style F2 fill:#b6d7a8
    style F2_new fill:#b6d7a8

## UI Architecture (Feature-Sliced Design)
- Principles: modularity, clear responsibility boundaries, reusability, scalability, business-oriented structure.
- Layers and import rule: a layer may import only from layers strictly below it.
  - `app`: app init, global styles, routing.
  - `pages`: page composition layer (assembles widgets, features, entities).
  - `widgets`: self-contained UI blocks (header, sidebar) that compose features/entities.
  - `features`: user-value functionality with business logic (e.g., add-to-cart).
  - `entities`: business entities (User, Product), mainly data + simple logic.
  - `shared`: reusable, non-business-specific code (UI kit, utils).
- Slices and segments: most layers (except `app`, `shared`) split into domain-specific slices; each slice uses standard segments:
  - `ui/` (components, styles), `model/` (state, business logic), `api/` (backend interaction), `lib/` (helpers), `config/`.
- Public API: each slice exposes a single `index.ts` (or platform-equivalent) exporting only intended public surface.
- Development flow: bottom-up (recommended) from `shared`/`entities` upwards; top-down allowed for prototyping with expected refactor.
- Rationale: strict dependency control, faster code navigation, encapsulation via Public API.
- Relation to DDD/VSA: FSD on frontend mirrors Vertical Slice Architecture on backend; `entities` map to DDD Entities/Aggregates, `features` to application services/use-cases.

## Monorepo Support
- **Purpose:** To enable the Memory Bank to operate effectively within monorepositories by identifying individual subprojects and maintaining separate, isolated memory banks (PRD.md, ARCH.md) for each, in addition to a root memory bank for the entire monorepo.
- **Subproject Detection Logic:**
  1.  **Define Project Root Markers:** Identify common configuration files that signify the root of a project.
      -   JavaScript/TypeScript: `package.json`
      -   Python: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`
      -   Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`
      -   Ruby: `Gemfile`
      -   Rust: `Cargo.toml`
      -   C/C++: `CMakeLists.txt`
      -   Go: `go.mod`
      -   Other: `.git` (if not using no-git mode), `.vscode`, etc. (as secondary indicators if primary are absent).
  2.  **Recursive Directory Scan:**
      -   Start scanning from the current workspace root.
      -   Recursively traverse each subdirectory.
      -   In each subdirectory, check for the presence of any defined "project root markers".
      -   If a marker is found, consider the current directory as a subproject.
      -   **Crucial Rule:** If a directory is identified as a subproject, its subdirectories are **not** scanned for further nested subprojects. This prevents double-counting and ensures a clear, top-level subproject identification.
- **Memory Bank Creation for Subprojects:**
  -   For each detected subproject (directory containing a project marker):
    -   Create a `memory-bank/` folder structure inside the subproject's root directory.
    -   Create `memory-bank/system/PRD.md` within this subproject's memory bank using the standard PRD template.
    -   Create `memory-bank/system/ARCH.md` within this subproject's memory bank using the standard ARCH template. This ARCH.md should be initially populated by analyzing the *subproject's* structure.
    -   Create `memory-bank/tasks/` directory for storing tasks specific to this subproject.
    -   Create `memory-bank/system/ISSUES.md` for tracking issues specific to this subproject.
- **Task Isolation for Subprojects:**
  -   Tasks related to a specific subproject MUST be created within that subproject's `memory-bank/tasks/` directory.
  -   Task IDs for subproject tasks include the subproject identifier: `YYYY-MM-DD_TASK-XXX_subproject-name_task-name/`.
  -   Each subproject maintains its own task counter and context.
  -   When working on a subproject task, the context is limited to that subproject's scope.
- **Root Memory Bank:**
  -   The main workspace root will always have its `memory-bank/` (the one currently being used). This root memory bank will contain overarching PRD and ARCH for the entire monorepo, and may include references or summaries of the individual subprojects.
  -   Root tasks are used for cross-cutting concerns affecting multiple subprojects.
- **Integration with Startup:** During mode initialization, after the initial workspace scan, the monorepo detection logic will run. If subprojects are found, their respective memory banks will be initialized/updated.
- **Subproject Context Switching:** When switching between subprojects, the system automatically loads the appropriate memory bank context for that specific subproject.

## Architecture Documentation Discovery & Integration
- **Purpose:** Automatically discover, analyze, and integrate existing documentation (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) into structured ARCH.md and PRD.md files while maintaining bidirectional references for AI systems.
- **Search Locations:**
  1. **Common Documentation Directories:**
     - `spec/`, `specs/`, `documentation/`, `docs/`, `architecture/`, `design/`
     - `doc/`, `wiki/`, `notes/`, `planning/`
  2. **Agent/AI Configuration Files (Priority):**
     - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CURSOR.md`
     - `.cursor/`, `.ai/`, `.agents/` directories
     - `HOW_TO_*.md`, `*_RULES.md`, `*_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
  3. **Architecture-Specific Files:**
     - `ARCH.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture.md`
     - `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, `SYSTEM.md`
     - `README.md` (for architectural sections)
- **Information Classification & Extraction:**
  - **Product Requirements (→ PRD.md):**
    - Project goals and objectives
    - User requirements and use cases
    - Functional and non-functional requirements
    - Business constraints and acceptance criteria
    - Target audience and stakeholder information
  - **Architecture Information (→ ARCH.md):**
    - System architecture and design patterns
    - Technology stack and frameworks
    - Component structure and interactions
    - Design decisions and rationale
    - Technical constraints and assumptions
    - Integration points and dependencies
- **Bidirectional Reference System:**
  1. **Update Original Files with References:**
     ```markdown
     > **📋 STRUCTURED DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE**
     >
     > This information has been organized into structured documentation:
     > - **Architecture Details:** See `memory-bank/system/ARCH.md`
     > - **Product Requirements:** See `memory-bank/system/PRD.md`
     >
     > For AI systems: Please review both structured files for complete context.
     ```
  2. **Add Source References in Generated Files:**
     ```markdown
     <!-- In ARCH.md -->
     > **📚 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION**
     >
     > This document consolidates information from:
     > - `AGENTS.md` - AI agent instructions and system context
     > - `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific configuration and guidelines
     > - `docs/architecture.md` - Original architectural documentation
     >
     > Refer to source files for additional context and details.

     <!-- In PRD.md -->
     > **📚 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION**
     >
     > This document consolidates requirements from:
     > - `AGENTS.md` - System objectives and AI requirements
     > - `spec/requirements.md` - Detailed functional requirements
     >
     > Refer to source files for additional context and details.
     ```
- **Integration Process:**
  1. **Discovery Phase:**
     - Scan all specified locations for documentation files
     - Read and analyze content of found files
     - Classify information as PRD-relevant or ARCH-relevant
  2. **Content Extraction:**
     - Extract product requirements, goals, and business context
     - Extract technical architecture, design decisions, and constraints
     - Preserve important context and rationale from original files
  3. **Structured Document Creation:**
     - Populate PRD.md template with extracted requirements information
     - Populate ARCH.md template with extracted architectural information
     - Add source references and traceability information
  4. **Original File Updates:**
     - Add reference headers to original files pointing to structured docs
     - Preserve original content while adding navigation aids
     - Ensure AI systems understand the relationship between files
- **AI System Integration:**
  - **Clear Navigation:** Original files contain explicit references to structured docs
  - **Complete Context:** Structured docs reference original files for full context
  - **Bidirectional Traceability:** Changes in either location should reference the other
  - **AI Instructions:** Explicit guidance for AI systems to check both locations
- **Integration with Startup:** Run documentation discovery and integration after workspace scan, create/update both ARCH.md and PRD.md, then update original files with references

## Environment Integration Strategy (Single Source of Truth + Display Tools)
- **Purpose:** Maintain unified file-based task management as the single source of truth while leveraging environment display tools for enhanced user experience and agent automation.
### **Architecture Overview:**
```
[File-based Memory Bank]  ←──── Single Source of Truth ────→  [Task Definitions & History]
           ↑                                                              ↑
           │                     Synchronization                         │
           │                    ←─────────────→                         │
           ↓                                                              ↓
[Environment TODO]       ←──── Display & UX Tools ────→      [Environment Checklist]
     (Visual)                                                      (Granular Tracking)
```

### **System Components:**

#### **1. File-based Memory Bank (Source of Truth)**
- **Location:** `memory-bank/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD_TASK-XXX_name/`
- **Purpose:** Permanent storage, complete history, detailed context
- **Contents:** `_task.md`, phase files, artifacts, specifications
- **Ownership:** Memory Bank system maintains and controls

#### **2. Environment TODO (Display Interface)**
- **Purpose:** High-level task visibility and quick navigation for user
- **Content:** Current task status, phase indicators, progress summaries
- **API Schema:**
  ```json
  {
    "plan": {
      "title": "VAN Analysis - User Authentication System",
      "steps": [
        { "id": "van-001", "title": "Requirements Analysis", "status": "done" },
        { "id": "van-002", "title": "Architecture Review", "status": "in_progress" },
        { "id": "van-003", "title": "Integration Assessment", "status": "pending" }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Statuses:** `pending | in_progress | done | skipped | blocked | failed`

#### **3. Environment Checklist (Execution Tracking)**
- **Purpose:** Step-by-step progress visibility during active work
- **Content:** Phase-specific checklists, granular progress tracking
- **Integration:** Maps to checklist templates (VAN, PLAN, IMPLEMENT, QA)
- **Real-time Updates:** Reflects current work progress
### **Information Flow:**
```
1. Task Creation:
   File-based: Create task folder + _task.md
   ↓
   Environment: Generate TODO with high-level overview
   ↓
   Environment: Generate Checklist with phase-specific steps

2. Progress Updates:
   Agent Work: Update file-based progress
   ↓
   Sync: Reflect changes in Environment TODO/Checklist
   ↓
   User Interface: Show updated progress visually

3. Task Completion:
   File-based: Archive with full context
   ↓
   Environment: Mark TODO/Checklist as completed
   ↓
   Cleanup: Remove from active environment display
```
### **Synchronization Rules:**

#### **File-to-Environment Sync (Primary Direction)**
- **Trigger:** Any file-based task state change
- **Process:** Parse task files → Update environment displays
- **Content:** Task title, current phase, progress percentage, next steps

#### **Environment-to-File Sync (User Actions)**
- **Trigger:** User marks items in environment interface
- **Process:** Update corresponding file-based tracking
- **Validation:** Ensure file-based remains authoritative

#### **Conflict Resolution:**
- **Priority:** File-based system always wins
- **Process:** Environment reflects file-based state, never overrides
- **Recovery:** Re-sync environment from files if conflicts detected
### **Environment Display Formats:**

#### **TODO Format:**
```

  3. If unavailable → File-only mode with console progress updates
  4. Log integration status for user awareness

  During Operation:
  - Environment available: Update both file and environment displays
  - Environment unavailable: Update files only, show progress in console
  - Environment fails: Log error, continue with file-only, inform user

  File-based Fallback:
  - Task progress: Update _task.md with detailed progress tracking
  - Checklist items: Embed progress checklists directly in phase files
  - Progress display: Show completion percentages in console output
  - Status tracking: Maintain all tracking in memory-bank/ file structure

  User Experience:
  - Environment mode: Rich visual feedback via TODO/Checklist tools
  - File-only mode: Text-based progress updates, embedded checklists in markdown
  - Both modes: Complete functionality and full Memory Bank features
  - Seamless transition: User gets same information, different presentation

## Documentation Integration Example
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate how existing documentation is discovered, integrated, and cross-referenced.
- **Scenario:** Project with existing `AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture.md` files
- **Before Integration:**
  ```
  project/
  ├── AGENTS.md                    # Contains AI instructions and system context
  ├── docs/
  │   └── architecture.md          # Contains technical architecture details
  └── memory-bank/
      └── system/
          ├── PRD.md               # Empty or basic template
          └── ARCH.md              # Empty or basic template
  ```
- **After Integration:**
  ```
  project/
  ├── AGENTS.md                    # Updated with references to structured docs
  ├── docs/
  │   └── architecture.md          # Updated with references to structured docs
  └── memory-bank/
      └── system/
          ├── PRD.md               # Populated with requirements from AGENTS.md
          └── ARCH.md              # Populated with architecture from both files
  ```
- **Updated AGENTS.md Example:**
  ```markdown
  # AI Agents Configuration

  > **📋 STRUCTURED DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE**
  >
  > This information has been organized into structured documentation:
  > - **Architecture Details:** See `memory-bank/system/ARCH.md`
  > - **Product Requirements:** See `memory-bank/system/PRD.md`
  >
  > For AI systems: Please review both structured files for complete context.

  ## Original Content
  [Original AGENTS.md content remains unchanged...]
  ```
- **Generated PRD.md Example:**
  ```markdown
  # PRD — Product Requirements Document

  > **📚 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION**
  >
  > This document consolidates requirements from:
  > - `AGENTS.md` - System objectives and AI requirements
  > - `docs/requirements.md` - Detailed functional requirements
  >
  > Refer to source files for additional context and details.

  ## Project Goal
  [Extracted from AGENTS.md system objectives...]

  ## Functional Requirements
  [Extracted from various source files...]
  ```
- **Generated ARCH.md Example:**
  ```markdown
  # ARCH — Architecture Overview

  > **📚 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION**
  >
  > This document consolidates information from:
  > - `AGENTS.md` - AI agent instructions and system context
  > - `docs/architecture.md` - Original architectural documentation
  >
  > Refer to source files for additional context and details.

  ## Architecture Overview
  [Consolidated from docs/architecture.md...]

  ## Key Decisions and Rationale
  [Extracted from AGENTS.md and architecture.md...]
  ```

## MCP External Tools Integration (Min)
- General usage:
  - Always use available MCP tools for analysis, planning, and QA where applicable.
  - Record key findings in `artifacts/phase-context.md` and use them to inform decisions.
- Library and language documentation:
  - Discover suitable MCP tools at runtime to locate and fetch documentation for libraries and programming languages.
  - Resolve identifiers/endpoints as needed and consult docs before design and implementation decisions.
- UI testing (QA and during IMPLEMENT when UI exists):
  - Use Playwright via MCP for UI/interactive app testing.
  - Ensure bounded execution with tool-native timeouts; if unavailable, run with shell prefix.
- Test Timeout Policy:
  - If a test tool lacks a configured timeout, execute with prefix: `timeout <X>s <test-command>` (default X=60).
  - Prefer tool-native timeouts when available; otherwise enforce shell prefix to avoid hangs.
- VAN UI Workflow Scan (UI/interactive apps):
  - Scan current UI workflow/routes/screens and record in `artifacts/phase-context.md`.
  - Create a mandatory UI test coverage plan mapped to the current workflow.
- PLAN/CREATIVE UI Requirements:
  - Plan UI testing alongside UI design; validate that new UI integrates into the existing workflow.
  - If inconsistency is detected, add an entry to `BUGS.md` for follow-up.
